align silkscreen to components?
	remove silkscreen from pads

square up the board outline?

add useful silkscreen
	mark debug pins
	mark input polarities!
	mark and number the IO
	white patch to write on? (numbering etc)

several cleanup passes?

add artwork (OSHW, HS.G, EVLS, SASJ)
OSHW gear next to 6 pin debug header?

sprinkle some thanks elsewhere?
	allot of space left next to the blue pill on the bottom
