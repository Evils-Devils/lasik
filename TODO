align silkscreen to components?
	remove silkscreen from pads

square up the board outline?
	move the 12v terminal block so it aligns to the edge?

add useful silkscreen
	mark debug pins
	mark input polarities!
	mark and number the IO
	white patch to write on? (numbering etc)

several cleanup passes?
	under BP and between pins
		left and right of pill done
	"fix" traces to final position, add ground zones
	

add artwork (OSHW, HS.G, EVLS, SASJ)
OSHW gear next to 6 pin debug header?
credit at the top left? (that cap is on the bottom layer)
sprinkle some thanks elsewhere?
	allot of space left next to the blue pill on the bottom
		github link etc?
		barcode?

resolve DRC errors? (only ones atm are due to the debug pins making the BP inputs misbehave)

add mounting holes?
add fiducials?

retract solder mask over the ground flood near the sensor input (bottom, no flood retract)

via stitching on GND
	maybe add a few easter eggs?
