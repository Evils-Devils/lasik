square up the board outline?
	move the 12v terminal block so it aligns to the edge?
	squared outline, set edge to 12v block, put rest of pcb at bottom
		move outline up, keep 12v block at edge and away from blue pill? (2.54mm grid!)

add useful silkscreen
	mark input polarities!
		words done, maybe add symbols?
	mark and number the IO
	white patch to write on? (numbering etc)

several cleanup passes?
	under BP and between pins
		left and right of pill done
	"fix" traces to final position, add ground zones
	

add artwork (OSHW, sasja)
OSHW gear next to 6 pin debug header?
credit at the top left? (that cap is on the bottom layer)
sprinkle some thanks elsewhere?
	allot of space left next to the blue pill on the bottom
		github link etc?
		barcode?

resolve DRC errors? (only ones atm are due to the debug pins making the BP inputs misbehave)

add mounting holes?
add fiducials?

via stitching on GND
	maybe add a few easter eggs?

spare IO, no go
